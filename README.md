<center><p>There are many characters in all 8 Harry Potter books. I'll start with Harry, Hermione, and Ron, and then work my way through the rest, in the order they are mentioned in the books.</p></center>

<img src="http://www.pngmart.com/files/3/Harry-Potter-PNG-Photos.png"/><p>At the age of eleven, Harry James Potter was small and skinny.<br> He had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses, and had a scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. It was also at the age eleven that Harry found out he was a wizard. And not just a wizard, but a famous one.</p>
<blockquote>At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort. Harry's parents had died in Voldemorts attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar and somehow Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.<i> - Page 4 of Chamber of Secrets</i></blockquote>

As Harry learns in Book 2 Of the Harry Potter Series, Tom <em>is</em> Lord Voldemort, more commonly known as "You-Know-Who." At the age of 16, Tom was a tall, black-haired boy. When he grew older, however, Tom changed into a man, whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes, and a nose that was flat as a snake's, with slits for nostrils.</p>

  <img src=""><p>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore is a tall, thin, and very old man, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. His eyes are light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose is very long and crooked, as though it had been broken many times.</p>
