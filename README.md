<img src="http://www.pngmart.com/files/3/Harry-Potter-PNG-Photos.png"/><p>At the age of eleven, Harry James Potter was small and skinny.<br> He had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses, and had a scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. It was also at the age eleven that Harry found out he was a wizard. And not just a wizard, but a famous one.</p>
<blockquote>At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort. Harry's parents had died in Voldemorts attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar and somehow Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.<i> - Page 4 of Chamber of Secrets</i></blockquote>
